# NLP-Programmatic Predicting Monitor For Disaster-Related Tweets 
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. Take the example of a tweet 'on plus look at the sky last night it was ABLAZE and so beautiful'. The author explicitly uses the word “ABLAZE” but means it metaphorically. This is clear to a human right away. But it’s less clear to a machine.

The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.
